# Estimating-State-Level-Doctoral-Degree-Attainment

## Overview

This project analyzes data from the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) provided by IPUMS USA. The primary focus is to estimate the total number of respondents in each state using the ratio estimator method, based on the number of respondents holding doctoral degrees. This estimation is then compared to the actual number of respondents from the ACS dataset.
